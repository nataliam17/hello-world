# hello-world
Hope to learn lots about the DevOps, QA, and all other Infrastructure Technology Roles!
I am a curious and eager learner that is excited to learn lots about the different realms of infrastrucutre. 
I specifically want to learn more about containerization such as Docker and Kubernetes. 
I love soccer, tacos, sushi, working out, reading, and mixing music! 
LA is great and I have a passion for helping people!
